    <string name="help_text">OneURL respects your privacy and does not store any personal information. For more information, please refer to our Privacy Policy. \nThe use of OneURL to shorten URLs is subject to the terms of use of the respective services provided by third-party providers. Please consult the terms and conditions of each service provider to learn more about their policies and restrictions.\n\nCosts and Rate Limits:\nThe providers available in the app are free of charge. Some providers therefore have rate limits. Exceeding the rate limit can lead to temporary or permanent blocking of your IP address with a provider. Please note that this blocking is managed by the service providers themselves.\nNormally, these limits should not be reached as a normal user. We recommend to respect the rate limits of the service providers and not to exceed them intentionally to ensure a seamless usage.</string>

    <string name="redirect_hint_text">Before redirecting, this provider displays a hint that informs the user about the destination URL.</string>
    <string name="privacy_text">This provider has been designed to be as data efficient as possible. It is operated from Germany and complies with the applicable privacy regulations in Germany and Europe.</string>
    <string name="emoji">Emoji</string>
    <string name="emoji_text">This URL shortener uses emojis to create personalized and easy-to-remember links. When specifying an alias, only emojis are allowed.</string>
    <string name="alias_text" tools:ignore="PluralsCandidate">The individual aliases can have a length between %1$d and %2$d characters and may only consist of the characters \"%3$s\". This feature allows users to create personalized and easy-to-remember aliases for their links.</string>
    <string name="analytics">Analytics</string>
    <string name="analytics_text">This provider offers the possibility to use analytics to get insights into the performance of the shortened links.</string>
    <string name="analytics_dagd">The provider da.gd offers the possibility to use analytics to get insights into the performance of the shortened links. With da.gd, the links must have been accessed at least once within the last 60 days, otherwise an error will be displayed (404).</string>
    <string name="owovc_fun_text">In addition to the normal URL shortener, owo.vc also offers other URL shorteners. These are intended for entertainment purposes and should be used respectfully, responsibly and with caution.</string>
    <string name="owovc_zws">The URL shortener \"owo.vc (zws)\" uses Zero-Width Spaces in the generated links. These spaces are invisible, which is why all links appear the same (\"owo.vc/\"). When copying and pasting in certain apps, these spaces may be removed. In such cases, the standard owo.vc page will open instead of the intended destination URL. Therefore, use this service with caution.</string>
    <string name="owovc_sketchy">The URL shortener \"owo.vc (sketchy)\" generates suspicious-looking URLs containing keywords like \"bank-login\", \"password\", \"hidden\", \"grab\" or \"account\" along with popular website names.</string>
    <string name="owovc_gay">The URL shortener \"owo.vc (gay)\" employs offensive and sexist language and may represent inappropriate or offensive content. Be aware that the generated links may contain sexist terms and could be considered offensive and disrespectful by others. Use this service with respect and responsibility.</string>
    <string name="zwsim_zws">The URL shortener \"zws.im\" uses Zero-Width Spaces in the generated links. These spaces are invisible, which is why all links appear the same (\"zws.im/\"). When copying and pasting in certain apps, these spaces may be removed. In such cases, the standard zws.im page will open instead of the intended destination URL. Therefore, use this service with caution.</string>
    <string name="tly_info">This URL shortener utilizes multiple domains for the same service, meaning it may generate short URLs with different domain names (e.g., tinyurl.com). Therefore, use this service with caution.</string>
    <string name="shorturlat_info">The URL shortener shorturl.at does not offer an API and is therefore not as reliable as other providers in this app. In addition, links with less than one click per month are deactivated. Therefore, use this service with caution.</string>
